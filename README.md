# gitlabApiValidation
Validated gitlab apis using Jasmine test framework

Medical industries like mine requires test engineers to validate "off the shelf" softwares in use for ex: gitlab, slack etc.

Adding the tests to Github so that anyone in need can use them.


To run the tests:

1. Clone repository
2. npm run install
3. Update "siteURL" and "token" in "spec/support/gitTest/git.spec.js"
4. "npm run test"
